“Analysis of Cumulative GPU Energy Consumption Across CNN Architecture Models” 

The project investigates how CNN feature channel width and numerical precision (FP32 vs mixed precision) affect training performance and estimated GPU energy consumption.  

# Project Overview:
Modern CNN training prioritises accuracy, often overlooking computational energy cost. This project explores how architectural scale and precision choices influence energy efficiency during training.
